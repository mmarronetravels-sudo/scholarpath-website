# ScholarPath Systems Website (v2)

Updated company website with portal preview mockups instead of "Launch" buttons.

## Changes from v1

- Removed "Launch GradTrack" buttons (no direct access to app)
- Added "Portals" section with mockup previews of:
  - Student Portal
  - Counselor Portal
  - Parent Portal
- All CTAs now point to "Request a Demo"

## Deployment

Since this is already connected to GitHub, simply:

1. Replace the files in your `scholarpath-website` repo with these new files
2. Vercel will automatically redeploy

### To update the repo:

1. Go to github.com/mmarronetravels-sudo/scholarpath-website
2. Navigate into the `scholarpath-site` folder
3. Delete all existing files
4. Upload these new files
5. Commit changes

Vercel will automatically detect the changes and redeploy.
