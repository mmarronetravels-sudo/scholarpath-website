        <p><strong>Where Data is Stored:</strong></p>
        <p>All data is stored on Supabase, a SOC 2 Type 2 certified database platform hosted on Amazon Web Services (AWS) infrastructure in the United States.</p>

        <p><strong>Service Providers (Subprocessors):</strong></p>
        <p>We use the following third-party services to operate our products:</p>

          <thead>
            <tr>
              <th>Provider</th>
              <th>Purpose</th>
              <th>Certification</th>
            </tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody>
            <tr>
              <td>Supabase</td>
              <td>Database hosting & authentication</td>
              <td>SOC 2 Type 2</td>

              <td>Web application hosting</td>
              <td>SOC 2 Type 2</td>
            </tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>
        
        <p><strong>Legal Requirements:</strong></p>
        <p>We may disclose information if required by law, such as in response to a valid subpoena or court order. We will notify the affected school before disclosure unless legally prohibited from doing so.</p>

        <h2>6. Data Retention</h2>
        <p>We retain student data only as long as necessary to provide our services or as required by our agreement with each school.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Active student data is retained while the student is enrolled and the school maintains an active account</li>
          <li>Upon school request, we will delete all school data within 30 days</li>
          <li>Audit logs may be retained for up to 3 years for security and compliance purposes</li>
          <li>Backup data is automatically deleted within 90 days of primary data deletion</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>7. School and Parent Rights</h2>
        <p><strong>Schools Have the Right To:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Access all data associated with their school</li>
          <li>Export their data in standard formats</li>
          <li>Request correction of inaccurate data</li>
          <li>Request deletion of all their data</li>
          <li>Receive notification of any data breaches</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p><strong>Parents/Guardians Have the Right To:</strong></p>

          <li>View their student's graduation progress through the parent portal</li>
          <li>Request access to their student's data through the school</li>
          <li>Request corrections through the school</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Note: Because ScholarPath Systems operates under the direction of schools as a "school official" under FERPA, parents should direct data access and correction requests to their school, which will coordinate with us as needed.</p>

        <h2>8. FERPA Compliance</h2>
        <p>ScholarPath Systems operates as a "school official" under FERPA, meaning:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>We perform institutional services that schools would otherwise perform themselves</li>
          <li>We are under the direct control of the school regarding data use</li>
          <li>We use education records only for authorized purposes specified in our agreements</li>
          <li>We comply with FERPA's restrictions on re-disclosure of student information</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Our Data Processing Agreement with each school establishes the specific terms of our school official relationship and data handling obligations.</p>

        <h2>9. Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>Our products are designed for use by schools to track student academic progress. We do not knowingly collect information directly from children under 13. All student data is provided by schools in accordance with FERPA and applicable state laws.</p>
        <p>For students under 18, schools are responsible for obtaining any necessary parental consent as required by law.</p>

        <h2>10. Data Breach Notification</h2>
        <p>In the event of a data breach affecting student information, we will:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Notify affected schools within 24 hours of discovering the breach</li>
          <li>Provide details about what data was affected</li>
          <li>Describe the steps we are taking to address the breach</li>
          <li>Cooperate with schools in notifying affected individuals as required by law</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>11. Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify partner schools of material changes by email at least 30 days before they take effect. The "Effective Date" at the top of this policy indicates when it was last revised.</p>
